# Chronic Disease Prediction System
# Overview
The Chronic Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict potential chronic diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. It offers a user-friendly GUI and utilizes multiple algorithms to ensure accurate predictions. This tool aims to assist users in taking proactive measures by consulting medical professionals at an early stage.

# System Architecture
The system is composed of three main components:

1.Data Processing: Cleans and formats input data for machine learning models.
2.Prediction Models: Uses machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) to make predictions.
3.User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input symptoms and view results.

# Future Improvements
1.Add more diseases and symptoms to the database.
2.Implement more advanced algorithms such as deep learning models.
3.Develop a web-based or mobile version of the application for broader accessibility.
4.Provide confidence scores for predictions to enhance reliability.
